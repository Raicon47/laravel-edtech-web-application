# About Project

This is a EdTech application built using Laravel, Bootstrap and Fluutterwave payment gateway

# How it Works

You first of all sign up, then pick a course. Make payment (i suggest you click on the transfer and agree that you've made payment.)

Now you can go through the courses you selected.
